How to Serial communication between STM32 board and Arduino or ESP32 Board
## Introduction
The serial communication makes sure every byte of the data is transferred to the other device. 
RX receives serial data and TX sends the serial data to other board or device. 
In this write-up, serial communication in Arduino is explained in detail with the help of a simple example.
